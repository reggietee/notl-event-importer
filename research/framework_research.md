# Web Framework Research

## Next.js vs React Comparison

### React
- **Type**: UI library for building component-based applications
- **Features**:
  - Virtual DOM for efficient rendering
  - Component-based architecture
  - JSX syntax for combining JavaScript and HTML
  - One-way data binding
  - Hooks for state management and side effects
- **Advantages**:
  - Flexible and customizable
  - Large community and ecosystem
  - Easy to learn with extensive documentation
  - Performance optimization through virtual DOM
  - Reusable components
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires additional libraries for routing, state management
  - No built-in server-side rendering
  - Frequent ecosystem updates can be hard to keep up with
  - Can have unnecessary re-rendering if not optimized

### Next.js
- **Type**: React framework with additional features
- **Features**:
  - File system routing
  - Server-side rendering (SSR)
  - Static site generation (SSG)
  - API routes
  - Built-in image optimization
  - Automatic code splitting
- **Advantages**:
  - Improved SEO through server-side rendering
  - Better performance with automatic optimizations
  - Simplified routing through file system
  - Built-in API routes for backend functionality
  - Simplified deployment
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Steeper learning curve than plain React
  - Less flexibility in project structure
  - More opinionated about how code should be organized
  - May include features not needed for simple applications

## Framework Selection for Event Importer Application

### Requirements Analysis
For our event importer application, we need:
1. Form for submitting event URLs
2. Web scraping functionality
3. WordPress API integration
4. Preview and editing capabilities
5. Simple deployment

### Recommendation: Next.js
Next.js is recommended for this application because:
1. **API Routes**: Built-in API routes can handle the web scraping and WordPress API integration server-side
2. **Server-side Processing**: Better for handling web scraping operations
3. **Form Handling**: Simplified form submission and validation
4. **Deployment**: Easier deployment options, especially with Vercel
5. **File Structure**: Organized file structure for routes and API endpoints

### Implementation Approach
- Use Next.js App Router for page routing
- Create API routes for web scraping and WordPress integration
- Use server components for data fetching
- Implement client components for interactive UI elements
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling (supported out of the box)
